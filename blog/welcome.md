# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! 🤖

Welcome to our comprehensive learning platform dedicated to **Physical AI** and **Humanoid Robotics**!

{/* truncate */}

## 🎯 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence—systems that don't just process data in the cloud, but interact with and understand the physical world through robotic embodiment.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This platform features:

- **43 comprehensive chapters** across 4 core modules
- **Interactive AI chatbot** for instant help
- **Hands-on code examples** in ROS 2, Python, and more
- **Real-world applications** from simulation to deployment

## 🤖 Four Core Modules

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Master the Robot Operating System 2 - the backbone of modern robotics.

### Module 2: Gazebo & Unity Simulation
Create digital twins and test robots in photorealistic environments.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
Harness GPU-accelerated robotics with cutting-edge AI perception.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models
Build conversational humanoids that understand and execute natural language commands.
