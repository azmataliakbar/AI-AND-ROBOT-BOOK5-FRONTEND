## 🤖 AI Chat Assistant

One of our platform's standout features is the **AI-powered chatbot** that can answer your questions in real-time!

### How It Works

The chatbot uses:

- **FastAPI Backend** - High-performance Python backend serving the AI

### Try It Out!

Click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and ask questions like:
- "What is ROS 2?"
- "How do I set up Gazebo simulation?"
- "Explain Vision-Language-Action models"

The chatbot provides **cited responses** with chapter references so you can dive deeper!
